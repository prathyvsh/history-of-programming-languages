* History of Programming Languages

Catalog of programming languages and their history.

The history of building programming languages is preceeded by works in algebra, mathematical logic, and constructivism.

* Prior Art
* Syllogisms and ancient/medieval computation devices.
* Emergence of Algebraic language
* Marriage of logic and algebra
* Peirce/Frege revolution
* Logic of relatives
* Constructivism vs. Formalism
* Logicism
* Schönfinkel operators
* Gödel numbering
Gödel’s work can in essence be thought of as having a programming language. This is taken up by Chaitin in his book on algorithmic complexity.
* Emergence of computational formalisms

Curry/Schönfinkel, Russell/Post, Church, Gödel, Turing, Von Neumann/McCullough Pitts

* Inception of semantic studies

* Continuations

* Category theory

* F-Algebras / Origami Programming
Work by Erik Meijer, Richard Bird, Maarten Fokkinga, Ross Paterson, Jeremy Gibbons
